# The Mercator Descriptor: A Novel Global Descriptor for Loop Closure Detection

Welcome to the Mercator Descriptor repository! The Mercator Descriptor is a novel descriptor for loop closure detection and place recognition. This descriptor first uses a Mercator-like projection to generate a rotation-invariant descriptor from a frame of point clouds. Then, by constructing a database to store this new descriptor, it enables efficient matching between historical and current frames for loop closure detection.
